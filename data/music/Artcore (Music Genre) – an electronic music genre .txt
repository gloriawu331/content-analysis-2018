Artcore is an electronic music genre that mixes instrumental music with drum and bass and electro. The genre is mostly used in dōjin music.
Songs composed in the genre typically use piano or string instruments as the main instrument, but the electric guitar and other orchestral instruments are sometimes used as well. Most songs of the genre feature a more varied version of the trademark DnB beat, with a reduced bass.
Typically, songs will put more of an emphasis on the melody of the song, rather than the beat and bass.
The first song that was described using the term artcore was the song Narcissus At Oasis by Ryu* for the arcade game Beatmania IIDX 10th style in 2004.
The genre became recognized in the dōjin music community when An (AcuticNotes) started composing in the genre in 2009 after hearing Felys by onoken. He published his first solo album through Diverse System in 2011 which gained a large amount of recognition in the dōjin music community.
