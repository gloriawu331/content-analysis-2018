Festejo (from Spanish 'fiesta') is a festive form of Afro-Peruvian music. The dance is a staple in the Black coastal populations and it celebrates the emancipation of slaves. Festejo is recognized for its high energy and the improvisation carried out by the dancers. Some believe that its origins trace back to competitive dance circles performed by individuals playing caj√≥ns. Despite its African origins, people of all different backgrounds participate in the dance that many consider to be one of the greatest representations of Peruvian culture.
