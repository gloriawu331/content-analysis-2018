Within the broad movement of new-age music, neoclassical new-age music is influenced by and sometimes also based upon early, baroque[clarification needed] or classical music, especially in terms of melody and composition.[clarification needed] The artist may offer a modern arrangement of a work by an established composer or combine elements from classical styles with modern elements[vague] to produce original compositions. Many artists within this subgenre are classically trained musicians. Although there is a wide variety of individual styles, neoclassical new-age music is generally melodic, harmonic, and instrumental, using both traditional musical instruments as well as electronic instruments. Similar neoclassical elements can often be found within other genres besides new-age music, including electronic music, minimalist music, post-rock music and neoclassical dark wave music.[clarification needed]
The neoclassical new-age genre can be traced back to the origins of new-age music in the 1970s. For example, Mannheim Steamroller's Fresh Aire is an example of this genre.[why?][citation needed] While new-age music gradually came more and more to emphasize inspiration, relaxation, spirituality, and positive feelings, neoclassical new age has tended to emphasize artistic and aesthetic expression using classical idioms drawn chiefly from the Romantic period.[contradictory]
