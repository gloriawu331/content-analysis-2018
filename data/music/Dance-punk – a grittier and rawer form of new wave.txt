Dance-punk (also known as disco-punk or funk-punk) is a music genre that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the post-punk and new wave movements.
Many groups in the post-punk era adopted a more danceable style. These bands were influenced by funk, disco, synth and other dance music popular at the time as well as being anticipated by some of the 1970s work of Sparks, Iggy Pop. Groups of influence from the 1980s included Talking Heads, Public Image Ltd., New Order, Gang of Four, the Higsons, the Pop Group, Maximum Joy, the Brainiacs, Big Boys, Minutemen, Gary Allen, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. New York City dance-punk included Defunkt, Material, James Chance and the Contortions, Cristina Monet, Bush Tetras, ESG, and Liquid Liquid. German punk singer Nina Hagen had an underground dance hit in 1983 with "New York / N.Y.", which mixed her searing punk (and opera) vocals with disco beats.
Dance-punk was revived among some bands of the garage rock/post-punk revival in the early years of the new millennium, particularly acts such as LCD Soundsystem, Clinic, Death from Above 1979, Liars, Franz Ferdinand, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Bloc Party, the Faint, the Rapture, Shout Out Out Out Out, and Radio 4, joined by dance-oriented acts who adopted rock sounds such as Out Hud, or Californian acts like !!! and Moving Units. In the early 2000s Washington, D.C. had a popular and notable punk-funk scene, inspired by Fugazi, post-punk, and go-go acts like Trouble Funk and Rare Essence, including bands like Q and Not U, Black Eyes, and Baltimore's Oxes, Double Dagger, and Dope Body. In Britain the combination of indie with dance-punk was dubbed new rave in publicity for Klaxons and the term was picked up and applied by the NME to bands including Trash Fashion, New Young Pony Club, Hadouken!, Late of the Pier, Test Icicles, and Shitdisco forming a scene with a similar visual aesthetic to earlier raves.
