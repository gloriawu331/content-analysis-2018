Sophisti-pop is a subgenre of pop music. The term has been applied to music that emerged during the mid-1980s in the UK which incorporated elements of jazz, soul and pop. Music so classified often made extensive use of electronic keyboards, synthesizers and polished arrangements, particularly horn sections.
Stylus Magazine suggested that acts were influenced by the work of Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry's mid-1980s albums, BÃªte Noire and Boys and Girls. According to AllMusic, major artists included Simply Red, Sade, The Style Council, Basia, Swing Out Sister, Prefab Sprout and the early work of Everything but the Girl.
