The filmi-ghazal is a genre of filmi based on ghazal poetry in Hindi or Urdu, used in Indian films, especially Hindi cinema (Bollywood). The filmi-ghazals retain the couplet format and rhyme scheme similar to that in ghazals. However, instead of vocal or instrumental passages as interludes, the filmi-ghazal usually uses precomposed musical pieces.
Music directors like Madan Mohan composed notable filmi-ghazals extensively for Muslim socials in the 1960s and the 1970s.
