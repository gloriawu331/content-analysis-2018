Hyangak, literally "indigenous/native music," is a traditional form of Korean court music with origins in the Three Kingdoms period (57 BC-668 AD). It is often accompanied by traditional folk dances of Korea, known as hyangak jeongjae. These dances are performed in front of audiences—as opposed to the square dance more familiar to Westerners, which is primarily for the participants' enjoyment.
One important hyangak piece is Yeomillak (hangul: 여민락; hanja: 與民樂). Few hyangak pieces are performed in Chinese style; these include Pollyeong, Haeryeong (hangul: 해령; hanja: 解令), and Poheoja
