The sabar, which originated with the Serer people, is a traditional drum from Senegal (also played in the Gambia). It is generally played with one hand and one stick. Among its most renowned exponents was the Senegalese musician Doudou N'Diaye Rose. The sabar was used to communicate with other villages. The different rhythms correspond to phrases and could be heard for over 15 kilometers.
Sabar is also recognized as the style of music played while using this drum.
