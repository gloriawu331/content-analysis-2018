A Tillana or thillana is a rhythmic piece in Carnatic music that is generally performed at the end of a concert and widely used in classical indian dance performances. A Tillana uses tala-like phrases in the pallavi and anupallavi, and lyrics in the charanam. Some have theorized that it is based on the Hindustani tarana.
