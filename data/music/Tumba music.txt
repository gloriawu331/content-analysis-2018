Tumba is a musical form native to Aruba and Curaçao. It is of African origin, although the music has developed since it was introduced on the island in the 17th century. The Curaçao-born composer Jan Gerard Palm was the first composer to write Curaçao tumbas. The lyrics can be very explicit. Nowadays the Tumba takes influences from the merengue and Latin jazz.
