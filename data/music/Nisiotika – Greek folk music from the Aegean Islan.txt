Nisiotika (Greek: νησιώτικα) is the name of the songs and dances of Greek islands including a variety of Greek styles, played by ethnic Greeks in Greece, Cyprus, Australia, the United States and elsewhere.

The lyre is the dominant folk instrument and other like laouto, violin, askomandoura with Greek characteristics vary widely.
