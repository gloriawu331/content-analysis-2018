Pornogrind, also known as porngrind or pornogore, is a musical subgenre of grindcore and death metal that lyrically deals with sexual and pornographic themes, hence the name.
The genre is related to, and similar to, goregrind, but minor differences from goregrind include pornogrind having "simpler, slower, and more rock-like songs" as well as the genre's pornographic theme present in lyrics and album artwork, which "would keep them out of most stores." Zero Tolerance described pornogrind as "the most downright perverted of the lot, often adding a dollop of filthy groove and vocals straight from the toilet." Natalie Purcell, however, in her book Death Metal Music: The Passion and Politics of a Subculture, suggests that pornogrind is defined solely on the basis of its lyrical content and unique imagery, its focus on pornographic content.
Notable bands of the genre include Gut and Cock and Ball Torture.
