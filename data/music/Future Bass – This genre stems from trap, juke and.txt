Future bass is a music genre that arose around 2006 in the United Kingdom, United States, Japan, China and Australia. It is a broad genre of music, comprising a wide variety of sounds and rhythms normally produced by a synthesizer. The genre was pioneered by Flume and Cashmere Cat and was popularised in the mid-2010s by artists like Mura Masa, Marshmello and Louis the Child. 2016 was seen as the breakout year for the genre.
Taking a lot of characteristics from trap music, future bass is described as having a focus on a hard bassline (sometimes an 808) with detuned synthesizers, mostly sawtooth and square waves. The sound waves are often modulated using automation or low-frequency oscillation controlling the cutoff of an audio filter (typically a low- or high-pass filter) or the level of the wave to adjust the waveform's volume (to create a ‘wobble’). In addition, it is common to utilise a somewhat "twinkly"-sounding gradual rise in pitch during "risers" (pre-drop buildups of white noise), and arpeggio chords, vocal chops or vocoders. The drums consist of kicks and rapid fire hi hats that are taken from trap music.
Due to its popularity, future bass has spawned a few subgenres:
Future trap is a fusion between future bass and trap (which often features hard trap drops as opposed to often synth-laden future bass drops). DROELOE, RL Grime, Flux Pavilion and other producers have produced tracks of this subgenre.
Future core blends hardcore with the melodic content and sound design characteristics of future bass. It has been recognised as a genre among Japanese electronic music producers on SoundCloud since the release of a future core compilation album in early-mid 2017.
