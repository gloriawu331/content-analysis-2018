Beiguan (Chinese: 北管; pinyin: Běiguǎn; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Pak-kóan) is a type of traditional music, melody and theatrical performance between the 17th and mid-20th centuries. It was widespread in Zhangzhou (the southern part of China's Fujian province) and Taiwan. By the early 21st century its popularity had declined precipitously.
Beiguan usually uses the following instruments: two suona (oboes), bangzi (woodblock), daluo (large bossed gong), xiaoluo (small gong), bangu (high-pitched drum), tonggu (small drum), xiaobo (small cymbals), and dabo (large cymbals). It may also use dagu (large drum), various huqin, and plucked instruments.
