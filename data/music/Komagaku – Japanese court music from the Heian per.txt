Komagaku (高麗楽) is a form of Gagaku (traditional Japanese court music) form arranged in the Heian period mainly based on Koguryeo[disambiguation needed] music and sankangaku (the music of the Three Kingdoms of Korea and is often played as a dance accompaniment. In contrast to other forms of Gagaku, Komagaku uses no plucked string instruments, only winds and percussion.
