Nangma (ནང་མ་) is a genre of Tibetan dance music closely related to Toeshey. The word Nangma derives from the Persian word نغمه Naghma meaning melody. Both a band and a nightclub have been named after it. "Nangma" is the name of a four-person, traditional Tibetan band dedicated to these two styles of music. "Nangma" is also the name of a nightclub in Lhasa which plays this traditional music.
