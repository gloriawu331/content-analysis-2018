Kaseko is a musical genre from Suriname and French Guiana, a fusion of African, European and American styles. The term kaseko derives from the French expression casser le corps (break the body) which referred to a swift dance during the period when slavery was legal in the region. Kaseko is related to other local styles, such as winti and kawina; like them, it uses call-and-response vocals and complex rhythms. Instruments include drums, saxophone, trumpet and, sometimes, a trombone.
Kaseko first evolved out of Bigi Pokoe, which was a 1930s' style played by large brass bands during festivals, strongly influenced by Dixieland jazz. Later, calypso, rock and roll and other styles left an influence.
In the 1970s, Surinamese expatriates, living in the Netherlands, popularized kaseko.
