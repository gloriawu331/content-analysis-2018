Polo designates two forms of Venezuelan folk music. One that originates from Margarita Island and another one that is played in Coro, in the state of Falcón.
The Polo from Margarita is a song in décima form, that is: ten verses of eight syllables each.
The harmonic structure cycles between an initial major key and its relative minor, using the following repeated progression: III(I)-VII7(V7)-V7-i-iv-V7-i-VII7(V7) (the Roman numerals in parentheses represent chord functions in the initial major key).
Pending research about Cheché Acosta Fuguet (past), and the duo of Nano Bravo and Chucho Penso (current).
