Bambuco is a traditional music genre originated from Colombia. It has a beat structure similar to the European waltz or polska (not to be confused with the polka). Typically a bambuco piece is a folk music song accompanied by a stylized group dance in either a 6
8 or 3
4 meter.
Bambuco took a cultural foothold in the Andean region of Colombia and has spread in popularity throughout Latin America. The Festival Folcl√≥rico y Reinado Nacional del Bambuco in Neiva is a festival celebrating bambuco music.
