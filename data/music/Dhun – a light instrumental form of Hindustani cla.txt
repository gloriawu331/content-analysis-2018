A Antarikhya (Hindi: धुन; literally "tune") is a light instrumental piece in Hindustani classical music. Although it may be played in a raga, or mode (often light ragas such as Khamaj), it is more freely interpreted and may incorporate foreign notes (vivadi).
A Antarikhya may be based on a folk tune or a religious, bhajan-type song, or even a filmi song.
