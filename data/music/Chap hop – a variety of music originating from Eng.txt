Chap hop is music originating from England that mixes the hip hop genre with elements from the Chappist or steampunk subcultures and stereotypical English obsessions such as cricket, tea and the weather.
Two leading exponents of the genre are Professor Elemental and Mr. B The Gentleman Rhymer. Other names include Poplock Holmes & DJ WattsOn.
In 2011, Sir Reginald Pikedevant, Esquire, inspired by Regretsy's "Not Remotely Steampunk" section, released the music video "Just Glue Some Gears On It (And Call It Steampunk)" on YouTube, which quickly went viral and has generated over 900,000 views to date. It was named one of the top ten steampunk songs and was acclaimed by steampunk notables.
In March 2013, UK Education Secretary Michael Gove said he was "strangely addicted to 'chap hop' rappers." Mr. B noted the irony of this, since his music often pokes at members the establishment, commenting, "As a non-Etonian and thus an outcast within the cabinet, this is perhaps a little snook cocked at his colleagues."
