Skate punk (also known as skate rock, skatecore and skate-thrash) is both a skater subculture and a subgenre of punk rock music. Originally a genre of hardcore punk closely associated with skate culture, skate punk changed into a more melodic genre of punk rock in the 1990s. The term usually describes the sound of 1990s punk rock bands that have a fast, melodic sound, and similar 21st-century punk rock bands. Since the 1990s, skate punk has been a genre that features fast tempos, lead guitar playing (including guitar riffs and guitar solos), fast drumming (usually blast beats), and singing (sometimes including vocal harmonies). Featuring the fast tempos of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore, skate punk occasionally combines these with the catchy hooks of pop punk. Skate videos have traditionally featured this fast style of punk rock. This played a big part in the coining of the term "skate punk".
Skate punk was pioneered in the 1980s by bands such as the Big Boys and JFA. A lot of early skate punk bands are part of the hardcore punk movement nardcore, which emerged in Oxnard, California. Skate punk broke into the mainstream during the 1990s; skate punk bands such as The Offspring and Blink-182 had mainstream success during the 1990s. Skate punk's popularity continued in the early 2000s with the continued popularity of bands such as The Offspring and Blink-182 as well as bands such as Sum 41. During the 2010s, there was an emergence of newer skate punk bands. Influenced by older skate punk bands, these 2010s skate punk bands, including Trash Talk, Cerebral Ballzy and FIDLAR, gained cult followings by promoting their music on the Internet.
Noted by AllMusic for having "high-energy", skate punk features fast tempos. Many of the 1980s skate punk bands were hardcore punk bands. In the 1990s, it changed and was played by bands that sound more like pop punk and standard punk rock than hardcore punk. Also a skater subculture, skate punk's origins go back to skate culture and surf culture. Author Steve Fenton wrote, "There are approximately 100 Skate Punk bands that sound exactly like Blink 182 within every populated square mile of Europe." Author Sharon M. Hannon noted skate punk is known for "its fast guitars, driving bass lines, and surf music–style drums". According to Mark Lepage of Spin magazine, it often has a "double-time hup-two-three-four beat". Skate punk music often features singing and vocal harmonies. Rolling Stone described skate punk as "a sort of pop hardcore". Some skate punk music has lyrics that are about humor - "mostly of the smartass variety". A lot of skate punk music features lead guitar playing, guitar riffs, and sometimes guitar solos. Skate punk is described by AllMusic as having "thrashier guitars" than regular punk rock.

Many early skate punk bands are part of the hardcore punk movement nardcore, which emerged in Oxnard, California. Popular among skateboarders, 1980s hardcore punk bands with connections to skateboarding culture were labeled as "skate punk" - the origin of the term.

JFA member Brian Brannon said that Mörizen Föche, vocalist of the band Drunk Injuns and former employee of the magazine Thrasher, might be the one who first used the term "skate punk".
As skate punk became more popular during the 1990s, it changed into a more melodic genre.
