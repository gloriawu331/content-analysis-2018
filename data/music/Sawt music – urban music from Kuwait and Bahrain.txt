Sawt (Arabic: صوت‎ / ALA-LC: Ṣawt; literally "voice"; also spelled sout or sowt) is a kind of popular music found in Kuwait and Bahrain. Sawt is a complex form of urban music, originally performed by 'ud (plucked lute) and mirwas (a drum), with a violin later supplementing the arrangement.
Two men perform the dance, which is called “Zaffan”. Al-Sout is performed only at night gatherings of men. It is called “Samra” (nightly chat).
