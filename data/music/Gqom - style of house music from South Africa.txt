Gqom /ᶢǃʱòm/ (Igqomu)[pronunciation?] is a style of house music that emerged a decade into the 21st century from the city of Durban in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. The style features wavy and bass beats produced with software such as FruityLoops, and has gained prominence in London. The word gqom, sometimes expressed as qgom, igqom, gqomu or variants thereof, derives from an onomatopoeic combination of click consonants from the Zulu & the Xhosa [Nguni House] language that represents a hitting drum. Music connoisseurs who were actively and rigorously involved in influencing the masses to accept and embrace the new, shift-shaping sound included the likes of South African rapper,Okmalumkoolkat Gqom, Italian record label Gqom Oh owner, Malumz Kole ,Afrotainment record label owner , DJ Tira as well as music taste-maker and personal public relations liaison , Cherish LaLa Mankai   ,West Ink artist Madanon whom released one of the first Gqom hits in Durban titled unjani uqoh.
