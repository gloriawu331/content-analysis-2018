The galant style was an 18th-century movement in music, visual arts and literature. In Germany a closely related style was called the empfindsamer Stil. Another close relative is rococo style.[clarification needed] The galant style was drawn in opposition to the strictures of the Baroque style, emphasizing light elegance in place of the Baroque's dignified seriousness and high grandeur.
In music, the galant emphasis was on simplicity, immediacy of appeal, and elegance.
In fashion, galant featured perfumed handkerchiefs and powdered wigs for both sexes. The fantastic exotic asymmetry of bizarre silk patterns were symptomatic of galant tastes.[citation needed]
