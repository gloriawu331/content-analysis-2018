Darkstep (also known as Darkside[citation needed]) is a subgenre of drum and bass[better source needed] that fuses elements of dark drum and bass with uptempo breakbeats and ambient noises (similar to those characteristic of neurofunk). Darkstep music is typically composed in a chromatic scale. Off-time and erratically cut breakbeat samples feature prominently.[better source needed] Darkstep comes from techstep,[better source needed] whereas neurofunk relies on science fiction soundscape and clean production. Darkstep uses traditional 1990s basslines like the Reese bass.
