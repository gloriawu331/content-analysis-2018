The Greek New Wave (Greek: Νέο Κύμα, pronounced [ˈneo ˈcima]) was a movement in Greek music that started in the mid-1960s and lasted about a decade. It was a mixture of entechno and French chansons; it was so named by Giannis Spanos after the French Nouvelle Vague. Most of the Greek New Wave artists released their songs in the Greek label LYRA.
