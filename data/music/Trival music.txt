Tribal or Trival, also known as tribal-guarachero (Spanish for: sandal tribal, in reference to its folk roots), is a music genre resulted of a fusion of electronic/dance with Latin American music genres.
Trival is sometimes referred to as "3ball". Despite the similarity between the letter "b" and "v" in Spanish, it should not be confused with tribal house or tecnocumbia music.
The style originated from the lower and middle class neighborhoods of Mexico City, between year 2000-2001(Beginning of popularity) ("Vice News"interview with Eric Rincon) but then moved to Monterrey, Mexico in 2007, before moving to the US in 2008. It was most popular in the metropolitan areas and southern states with highly Latino populated areas until late 2013. Trival is popular with the young Latino community in parts of the US during the mid 1990s to present day, primarily with teenagers or young adults. One of the precursors and most popular of trival producers is the 3Ball MTY from Monterrey, Mexico.
Trival music is a fusion of genres such as regional Mexican music, including Mexican cumbia, and EDM genres such as techno, electro house and club music. With a 4/4 time signature, the genre is often made up of cascading triplets and a BPM of 140 to 280.[citation needed] The rhythm is employs Afro-Cuban rhythms and Latin synths.
As a dance and EDM music style, trival music can be used in solo dances with a unique dance movement, or in dance troupes to compete in danceoffs.[citation needed] Mexican pointy boots are often associated with trival music and are worn in these danceoffs.
