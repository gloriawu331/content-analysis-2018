Bent edge or curved edge was an offshoot of hardcore punk that was formed to be a counter-movement to straight edge at the time straight edge was starting to gain traction and support. Bent edge was also part of a rising anti-Dischord sentiment among many people in the punk scene.
It was started by members of Washington, DC hardcore scene who were fed up with the rigidness and intolerance in the nascent straight edge scene. To combat straight edge, they started throwing beer and drug-fuelled punk shows. The point of these shows was to be the complete antithesis of straight edge. Many adherents to this lifestyle became known for their heavy drug and alcohol use.
Quickly, this idea spread throughout the US. As early as 1982, only a year after Straight Edge was released, kids were approaching Minor Threat while they were on tour telling them that they were bent or curved edge. To Ian Mackaye, "the anti-movement started before the movement began. People were rebelling against straight edge before there was even a movement to rebel against".
At the time that bent edge started, there were several people living in the Dischord Records House that were not straight edge. Straight edge and non straight edge people mixed freely, but as time went on, the tolerance in the straight edge scene faded, adding momentum to the bent edge ideals.
