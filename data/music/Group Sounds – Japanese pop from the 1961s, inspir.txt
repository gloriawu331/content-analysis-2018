Group Sounds, often abbreviated as G.S. or G-Sound, is a genre of Japanese rock music which became popular in the mid to late 1960s and initiated the fusion of Japanese kayōkyoku music and Western rock music. Their music production techniques were regarded as playing a pioneering role in modern Japanese popular music.
Fōku (folk) and new music became famous in Japan in the 1970s, but new rock bands survived as new rock in Japanese underground music. The origin of modern Japanese rock music was usually regarded as new rock. Videos of New Rock bands' concerts were very rare.
