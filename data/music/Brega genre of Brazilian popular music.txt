Brega (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈbɾɛɡɐ]) is a genre of Brazilian popular music. The name, originally pejorative and discriminatory in nature (meaning "bordello"), has since somewhat lost this meaning. Historically, the greatest singers of the genre are from northeastern and northern Brazil; two of its biggest icons historically were Reginaldo Rossi and Falcão, the latter following a part of a tradition of humorous brega. Recently, groups such as Banda Calypso and Limão com Mel have been particularly popular.
