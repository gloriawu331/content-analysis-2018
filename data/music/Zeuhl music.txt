Zeuhl (pronounced [tsɔɪl] or [d͡zøːl]) is a style of progressive rock that originated in France in the 1960s. Pitchfork's Dominique Leone says the style is "about what you'd expect an alien rock opera to sound like: massed, chanted choral motifs, martial, repetitive percussion, sudden bursts of explosive improv and just as unexpected lapses into eerie, minimalist trance-rock.
The term means celestial in Kobaïan, the constructed language created by Christian Vander of the band Magma. Originally applied solely to the music of Magma, the term "zeuhl" was eventually used to describe the similar music produced by French bands beginning in the 1970s.
