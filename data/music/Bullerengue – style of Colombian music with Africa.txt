Bullerengue is a musical style and dance from the Caribbean Region of Colombia and the Darién Province in Panama. It is a cumbia-based style traditionally sung exclusively by women. Some famous bullerengue singers are Petrona Martinez, Irene Martinez, Emilia Herrera, Estefanía Caycedo, Etelvina Maldonado, and Ceferina Banquez. In recent decades, Petrona Martínez and Totó la Momposina have increased Bullerengue's international popularity and success, having been nominees for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album.
