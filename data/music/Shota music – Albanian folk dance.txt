Shota (or Shotë) is an Albanian dance very popular in Albania and Kosovo. It involves synchronised steps, and a strong rhythm. It is one of the most well known dances/songs from that region, and is commonly played at weddings, folk festivals and other events.
During the 1960s this dance was performed in Belgrade based on the choreography of Olga Skovran.
One folklore musical ensemble in SFR Yugoslavia was named Šota.
In March 2013 the Assembly of Republic of Kosovo approved a law which makes ‘Shota’ a part of the cultural activities of the National Ensemble of Songs and Dances.
Since the time of its inception the community keeps organising events that replicates the dance form Shota and are socially very active in areas of cleanliness, awareness about the dance form and the dress codes related to it.
