Panche baaja (Nepali: पञ्चे बाजा, "five musical instruments") is a set of five traditional Nepali musical instruments that are played during holy ceremonies,especially, marriages. Panche baajas are usually played by the Damai (Miji) and the Gaine; these are castes in the Hindu tradition.
The first part of the term is also transliterated pance, panchai, or pancai; the latter also as baaja.
The panche baja includes the jhyali (cybals), tyamko (small kettledrum) or dholak (drums), damaha (large kettledrum), narsiha (a long S-shaped trumpet), shehnai (a folk oboe), and karnal (a wide-mouthed, straight trumpet with a bell that resembles the datura flower.). http://yeahnepal.com/instruments-used-in-panche-baja/ Other rendering give the ensemble as: shehnai, jhyali, dholki, tyamko, and damaha.
